          <h1>YOGA</h1>
          <p>
            I have always loved to travel, but the first time I stepped onto a yoga mat, I finally felt at home.
            As I flowed through the class, I began travelling inwards, and my awareness shifted
            from the outer layers of my mind and into my body, and then even deeper.
            By the end of the class I was in tears, and in love.
            I had thought that yoga was all about strength and flexibility,
            but I realised in that moment it was so much more than physical
            – it was about the flexibility to open our hearts, and the strength to be ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of daily practice, in 2023 I completed my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training
            at One Yoga in Koh Phangan, studying Hatha and Vinyasa in a shala beside the ocean,
            immersed in a world of birdsong and gently breaking waves.
            It was a dream to be able to study there, and a dream to now teach this practice that I love so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            My classes aim to be a journey of playful exploration, with creative sequencing
            and thoughtful transitions helping ground you in the present moment,
            allowing space to notice sensations and emotions, and playlists carefully curated
            to help you lose yourself in the rhythm of breath and movement.
            My greatest aim is to empower everyone who attends my classes to feel, to listen to their body,
            and trust their instincts.
          </p>
          <p>
