          <h2>ABOUT GEMMA</h2>
          <br />

          Hello! I’m Gemma — a nature lover, backpacker, and believer in magic. The focus of my
          writing and photography is that magic, and my hope is to use my words and my lens to help
          shine light on the details which can sometimes be overlooked; the moments big and small —
          from spiderwebs to supernovas — that connect us to wonder, to the universe, and to each
          other.
          <br /><br />

          My hobbies include chasing waterfalls, talking to wildflowers, and staring absentmindedly
          out of windows.
          <br /><br />

          When I’m not doing any of those things I can be found at my desk, writing my first book —
          about a particularly magical year spent wandering the chalk grasslands and beech woodlands
          of my childhood home in the Chilterns.
