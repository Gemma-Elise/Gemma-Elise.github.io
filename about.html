          <h1>MY STORY</h1>
          <p>
            I have always loved to travel, but the first time I stepped onto a yoga mat, I finally felt at home. 
            As I flowed through the class, I began travelling inwards, 
            and my awareness shifted from the outer layers of my mind and into my body, and then even deeper. 
            By the end of the class I was in tears, and in love.
            On my yoga mat, I had felt the same sense of wonder I had previously only known in nature.
            But this time there was no rainforest, no mountaintop, no waterfall; the miracle was within me.
            I had thought that yoga was all about strength and flexibility, 
            but I realised in that moment it was so much more than physical – 
            it was about the flexibility to open our hearts, and the strength to truly be ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of daily practice, in 2023 I completed my 200 hour training at One Yoga in Koh Phangan,
            studying Hatha and Vinyasa in a shala beside the ocean,
            immersed in a world of birdsong and gently breaking waves.
            In 2025 I returned for my 300 hour advanced training, with a focus on meditation and pranayama.
